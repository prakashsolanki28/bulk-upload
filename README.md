Hey there! This is a simple Node.js backend project for managing users with a CSV upload feature, MySQL database, Redis caching, and a RabbitMQ worker for processing data in the background. There's also a React frontend built with Vite to interact with the API. Here's how to get everything up and running.

## What's in This Project?
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, Sequelize for MySQL, Redis for caching, RabbitMQ for queue processing, and Swagger for API docs.
- **Frontend**: A React app built with Vite for a fast development experience.
- **Features**: Upload CSV files with user data, process them in the background, and fetch users with pagination and search.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have:
- Node.js
- MySQL (running locally or on a server)
- Redis (running locally or on a server)
- RabbitMQ (running locally or on a server)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Project
Grab the code from the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/prakashsolanki28/bulk-upload.git
cd bulk-upload
```

### 2. Set Up the Backend

```bash
cd backend
```

1. **Install Backend Dependencies**  
   Navigate to the backend folder (root of the project) and install the packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**  
   Create a `.env` file in the root folder and add the following:
   ```
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=your_mysql_user
   DB_PASS=your_mysql_password
   DB_NAME=bulkdata
   PORT=5000
   ```
   Replace `your_mysql_user` and `your_mysql_password` with your MySQL credentials. The `DB_NAME` is the database name (e.g., `bulkdata`).

3. **Set Up the Database**  
   Make sure MySQL is running. Create a database called `bulkdata` (or whatever you set in `DB_NAME`):
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE bulkdata;
   ```
   The project uses Sequelize to sync the database schema automatically, so you donâ€™t need to run any migrations.

4. **Start Redis and RabbitMQ**  
   Ensure Redis and RabbitMQ are running on your machine or server. For local setup:
   - **Redis**: Install and run Redis (default port: 6379).
     ```bash
     redis-server
     ```
   - **RabbitMQ**: Install and run RabbitMQ (default port: 5672).
     ```bash
     rabbitmq-server
     ```

5. **Start the Backend Server**  
   In the root folder, run:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The server will start on `http://localhost:5000` (or the port you set in `.env`). Youâ€™ll see logs like:
   ```
   MySQL DB connected
   Server running on port 5000
   Worker started...
   ```

6. **Check the API Docs**  
   Open `http://localhost:5000/docs` in your browser to see the Swagger API documentation.

### 3. Set Up the React Frontend


The React frontend is in a separate folder (e.g., `/frontend`). Hereâ€™s how to get it running:

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Folder**  
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install Frontend Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the React App**  
   The frontend uses Vite for a super fast dev server. Run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the React app, usually on `http://localhost:5173`. Open that URL in your browser to see the app.

4. **Using the Frontend**  
   The React app connects to the backend API (`http://localhost:5000/api/users`). You can:
   - Upload a CSV file with user data.
   - View a paginated list of users with search functionality.

### 4. How to Use the API
- **Upload Users**: Send a POST request to `/api/users/upload-users` with a CSV file. The file is processed in the background via RabbitMQ.
- **Get Users**: Send a GET request to `/api/users?page=1&limit=10&search=john` to fetch users with pagination and search.
- Check the Swagger docs at `/docs` for full details.

### 5. Troubleshooting
- **Backend wonâ€™t start?**  
   - Check if MySQL, Redis, and RabbitMQ are running.
   - Verify your `.env` file has the correct database credentials.
   - Look at the console for error messages (e.g., "Unable to connect to the DB").
- **Frontend not connecting to backend?**  
   - Ensure the backend is running on `http://localhost:5000`.
   - Check for CORS errors in the browser console. The backend already includes CORS middleware, but verify the API URL in your React app.
- **CSV processing stuck?**  
   - Confirm RabbitMQ is running and the worker is consuming messages (look for "Worker started..." in the logs).
   - Check the `/logs/failed_inserts.log` file for any failed database inserts.

### 6. Project Structure
- **Backend**:
  - `/src/models`: Database models (e.g., User).
  - `/src/routes`: API routes (e.g., userRoutes).
  - `/src/controllers`: Logic for handling requests.
  - `/src/workers`: RabbitMQ worker for CSV processing.
  - `/logs`: Logs for failed database inserts.
- **Frontend**:
  - `/frontend/src`: React components, API calls, and UI logic.
  - Built with Vite for fast development.

### 7. Notes
- The backend uses Redis to cache user data for 5 minutes to improve performance.
- The CSV upload splits data into chunks (1000 rows) and processes them via RabbitMQ to avoid overloading the server.
- The React app is lightweight and uses Vite, so itâ€™s super fast to develop and test.
